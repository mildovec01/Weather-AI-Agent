# AI-agent-email

## What did i create?
I tried and created a little automatization in sending an email via Gmail. Of course its not something big, but it is sure more for my career. 

## n8n
For this automatization i worked in -> n8n <- for the workflow. For using the .json file i put here, you just need to import the file to the workflow.
I am using n8n for like a week now and i am still willing to learn more and get as much experience as i can.
This is my first little project.

## Steps for import to n8n
1. --> Log-in to n8n
2. --> Create or open new workflow
3. --> In the new workflow you have in the right corner three dots next to "Save" or "Saved", click on that
4. --> Menu afterwards shows and you need to click "Import from File"
5. --> Select the .json file
6. --> You have done all you need.
