# AI-agent-email

## What did i create?
I tried and created a little automatization in sending a weather info for a morning via Gmail. Of course its not something big, but it is sure more for my career. 

## n8n
For this automatization i worked in --> [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) <-- for the workflow. For using the .json file i put here, you just need to import the file to the workflow.
I am using n8n for like a week now and i am still willing to learn more and get as much experience as i can.
This is my first little project.

## OpenWeatherMap
You need to create an account on this website --> [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) <-- it is free. After you register, an email will be sent to you with comfirmation of register and with new API key.
You can create a lot other API keys on your account. You need to wait a while to activate the key. You will put your API key in the OpenWeatherMap node and enjoy.

## AI Agent
You dont need to use OpenAI. If you have some other AI model to work with, just change the model under the agent.

## Gmail
Just connect your Google account and it is all done. Just change the "destination" e-mail. 

## Google Sheets
It is not compulsory to use this node, it just logs all the data, that this workflow outputs.

## Steps for import to n8n
1. --> Log-in or sign up to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/)
2. --> Create or open new workflow
3. --> In the new workflow you have in the right corner three dots next to "Save" or "Saved", click on that
4. --> Menu afterwards shows and you need to click "Import from File"
5. --> Select the .json file
6. --> You have done all you need.
